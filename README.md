## Known issues
- On some setup, you may need to add your domain to the system hosts file. If not, some assertions involving curl may fail.
- The testsuite fails on Windows when using the Command Prompt.
- On Windows, you will need to add *lower_case_table_names* = 2 in your database configuration file (my.cnf). The table and column names need to be stored in their natural case.
